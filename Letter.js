//This file should not require any other files.....

// This file contains a constructor letter this constructor should be able to either 
//display an underlying character or a blank placeholder (such as 
//an underscore), depending on whether or not the user has guessed the 
//letter. That means the constructor should define::::

// A string value to store the underlying character for the letter
// A boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet

// A function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been 
//guessed, or a placeholder (like an underscore) if the letter has not been guessed
// A function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against
// the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if it 
//was guessed correctly






HINT: Write Letter.js first and test it on its own before moving on, then do the same thing with Word.js

HINT: If you name your letter's display function toString, JavaScript will call that function automatically whenever casting that object to a string (check out this example: https://jsbin.com/facawetume/edit?js,console)
